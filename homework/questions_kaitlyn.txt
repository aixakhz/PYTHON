1. What are 3-5 (or more) commands that you can use on terminal and what do they do? What language is your computer terminal in?
    One command is "cd [file name]" which brings you to your desired file destination without touching the file folder. 
    Another is "ls" which shows you where you currently are in the terminal. 
    A last one is accessing python with "python3"
    I'm in Windows, so my laptop uses PowerShell.
2. Do you have pets? What kind?
    I only have one dog and he's a mix between German Shephard and a small dog since he's Corgi-sized.
3. If you run across an error, what would your first course of action be?
    First I'd read what the system is telling me about what is wrong and use it to correct my mistake.
4. Funniest thing that happened to you in high school.
    During the pandemic I was on discord w/ my friends in between classes, and after entering my class I said to my friends, "Okay I have to go to class now, talk to y'all later". My teacher asked me if I hated his class and I said no, then I muted myself and saw my friends get up from their screens because they got second hand embarrassment.
5. What is a python script? (Keep it simple)
    Python script is a file that contains code that needs to do something after being run directly. This file ends with .py
